# Exploring the Transmission Behaviour of Overwatch: The Source of Lag

This is the companion repository to the short paper and poster of the same name being presented at [ITC30](https://itc30.org/).


## Lag Simulation Model

This work is a refinement of the video game lag model defined in our [previous work](https://github.com/mas-ude/onlinegame-lag-sim). It attempts to apropriately model all the components that contribute to lag in online video games and combine them to a handy simulation framework.
